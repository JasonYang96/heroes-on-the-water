# Heroes on the Water 2.0
## Created by Swag Ramon
### AT&T Intern Coding Challenge, Summer 2016

Swag Ramon presents a fully responsive, end to end solution for the nonprofit Heroes on the Water. Features at a glance include a flat and minimal design, public-facing front-end with optimized donation and signup strategies, and an intelligent management system on the back-end to facilitate and lend structure to various levels of user access and responsibilities within the organization. Both facets of the website are responsive and look great on popular screen sizes. We hope that this take on Heroes on the Water proves useful, thought-provoking, and inspiring.

### Known Issues
* Event and inventory deletion is buggy. Regional deletion works but deleting nested documents throw errors.
* Managing permissions, participation, volunteering, and inventory tracking systems are functional for first event only.
* A manager can only manage one single entity, i.e. a chapter manager can only manage one single chapter and everything in that chapter.  
* Adding permisions to managers does not work on firefox. 

### Next Steps

Because we only had 3 weeks to work on the website, we had to prioritize features and user stories. Below is a list of features and capabilities that we would have added in future releases and iterations.  

* Facebook Authorization, to allow for easy signup and login
* Location Services, to show events that are nearest that person's location
* Functional Metrics Services, currently only the idea and foundation are present in the code 
* Graphs and charts to leverage metrics from above
* Time tracking and reporting services for volunteers and managers
* Email and Text notification system (we would've used the Twilio API)
* Easy integration with Facebook Events since more people are more comfortable using Facebook
* A fully featured iOS and Android wrapper app to make use of the responsive website
